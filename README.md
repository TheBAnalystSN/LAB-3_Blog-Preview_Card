# Lab 3 â€“ Developing with Bootstrap 

# Blog Preview Card

This lab refactors my previous Frontend Mentor project â€” the **Blog Preview Card** â€” to use **Bootstrap 5.3** for consistent styling, maintainability, and responsive design.

## Project Refactored
1. **Blog Preview Card**
   - Refactored using Bootstrapâ€™s card and grid system.
   - Applied `.badge`, `.text-muted`, and `.fw-bold` utilities for consistent typography.
   - Maintained hover/focus states with minimal inline styling.

## Tools and Frameworks
- [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- HTML5 and ARIA accessibility practices
- Google Fonts (Outfit & Figtree)

## What I Learned
- How to replace custom CSS with **Bootstrap utility classes** efficiently.
- How to use Bootstrapâ€™s **grid system and cards** for clean, responsive layouts.
- How to combine **custom styling sparingly** for brand consistency.
